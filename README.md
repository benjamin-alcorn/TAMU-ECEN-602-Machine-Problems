# TCP Simple Broadcast Chat Server and Client

## Introduction
This is a simple broadcast chat server and client implementation in C, using TCP sockets and I/O multiplexing with `select()`. Multiple clients can connect to the server and send messages that will be broadcast to all other connected clients.

The server listens on a specified port and handles multiple clients concurrently, while the client connects to the server and allows users to send and receive messages in a chat room.

This project was generated by ChatGPT.
